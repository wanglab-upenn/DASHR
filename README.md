# DASHR
The source code contains the pipeline for generating the files deposited in DASHR - The Database of small human noncoding RNAs. 
Processing of the individual samples has been performed using SPAR.
SPAR is a sequencing-based pipeline for annotating novel small non-coding RNAs based on CoRAL [NAR'2013].
